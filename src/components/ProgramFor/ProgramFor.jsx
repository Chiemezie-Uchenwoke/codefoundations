                        You're a beginner who wants to learn web development the right way, not just from random YouTube tutorials.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <FaCheckCircle /> 
                        You're self-taught but feel stuck, especially with JavaScript.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <FaCheckCircle /> 
                        You've built some projects, but don't fully understand how things work under the hood.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <FaCheckCircle /> 
                        You feel overwhelmed trying to learn everything alone â€” you need structure, support, and real feedback.
